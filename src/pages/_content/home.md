our_story:
  content: >-
    It all started at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, where Nat and Lauren met in
    the dorms and were roommates throughout college. Matt and Matt ended up as
    roommates a few years later. We experienced growth, change, and heart-ache
    alongside of one another throughout those years forming deep, authentic, and
    lasting friendships. Community with one another became our heartbeat. We all
    got married the summer of 2010 and then embarked upon adulthood in separate
    parts of the world. 


    We stayed in touch, getting together often to reminisce, laugh, catch up,
    and dream about the future together. Community remained our heartbeat. As we
    dreamed about the future, we envisioned a life in which we could work
    towards something we care about and live and raise our children alongside
    one another, giving us an opportunity to pass along our love for community.
    Eight years and four children later, we live across the street from each
    other and are working to build a company that builds the type of community
    we love so much.
